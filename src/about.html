    This is project brough to you by two Bronx Science students. This was our first time working on web design, so we were unable to complete the project. However, we are happy with what we've learned.
   	<br>

    The AP items changes brought out a very large change in the build paths of many AP champions such as Azir, which thus led to different pick rates. This tool was meant to analyze that pick rate between patches 5.11 and 5.14. However, the rate limit prevented us from scanning through all given matchIds and we ran out of time figuring out an alternative method as we were packing for our upcoming freshman year in college.
    <br>
    We provide a google bar graph that displays the information, but again, is incomplete.
    <br>
    We plan to complete this project in the future. I would really like to thank Riot Games for this opportunity and incentive to learn about web design. I don't expect to win the API challenge, but I am satisified that I managed to learn a lot.
